# Sega Saturn Keyboard (HSS-0129)
The Sega Saturn Keyboard is an 89 key keyboard released for the Sega Saturn console.  It connects via the standard 9-pin Saturn controller and allowed you to use the Internet (in combination with the modem & mouse), program in Saturn BASIC (in combination with the floppy disc drive) and play Typing Of The Dead.<br>

I thought it might be interesting to reproduce it.<br>

 I dismantled my keyboard and figured out the keyboard matrix - it uses two thin film sheets to register key presses.<br>
